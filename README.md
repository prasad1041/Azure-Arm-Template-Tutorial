# Azure-Arm-Template-Tutorial
 The template is a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file that defines the infrastructure and configuration for your project
# Features Of Arm Template
 1. **Declarative syntax**
    Desired State Configuration: ARM templates use a declarative syntax, meaning you describe what you want rather than how to achieve it. You specify the resources and their configurations, and Azure Resource          Manager ensures that your Azure environment matches this desired state.
 2.**Repeatable results**
    deployments are consistent and repeatable. You can use the same template to deploy identical environments across different regions or subscriptions, minimizing the risk of configuration drift.
 3. **Orchestration**
    When deploying resources in Microsoft Azure using ARM (Azure Resource Manager) templates, Resource Manager handles the entire deployment process efficiently and intelligently.
    **Dependency Management**: Resource Manager evaluates the dependencies between resources defined in the template. If a resource depends on another resource (e.g., a virtual machine depends on a virtual              network),Resource Manager ensures that the dependent resource is created first.
    **Correct Order:** By understanding these dependencies, Resource Manager orchestrates the deployment in the correct order. This ensures that all necessary prerequisites are met before a resource is created.
 4. **Modular files**:
 5. **Preview changes**
     You can use the what-if operation to get a preview of changes before deploying the template.
 7. **Built-in validation**
    Your template is deployed only after passing validation. Resource Manager checks the template before starting the deployment to make sure the deployment will succeed. Your deployment is less likely to stop in a     half-finished state.
 8. **CI/CD integration**
     You can integrate templates into your continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) tools, which can automate your release pipelines for fast and reliable application and infrastructure updates
